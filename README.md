# Markaweb
A library that allows you to use markdown-style text to make a website!

We are currently coming up with a plan still but check the issues to get a sense of what we're working on!

# To Compile
This library is built on maven. To compile simply type 'mvn clean package' from the repo folder.

# To Run
To run, just run the java jar directly. It's recommended you use a new directory at first to avoid clutter. All markdown files will be viewable from the web (hopefully)
